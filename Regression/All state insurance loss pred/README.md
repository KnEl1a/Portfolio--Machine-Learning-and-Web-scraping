Competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/allstate-claims-severity

Allstate, a personal insurer in the U.S., is looking for innovative ways to improve their claims service by developing automated methods to predict the cost and severity of claims. In this Kaggle recruitment challenge, participants are invited to create an algorithm that accurately predicts claims severity. The competition offers a chance to demonstrate technical skills and potentially join Allstate's team. Submissions are evaluated based on the mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual losses.

**Dataset Description:**  
Each row represents an insurance claim, with the goal of predicting the value in the 'loss' column. Variables prefixed with 'cat' are categorical, and those with 'cont' are continuous.

**File Descriptions:**  
- `train.csv`: Training dataset.
- `test.csv`: Test dataset, where you need to predict the 'loss' value.
- `sample_submission.csv`: Example submission in the correct format.
